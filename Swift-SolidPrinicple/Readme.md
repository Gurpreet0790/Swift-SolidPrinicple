#  Solid Principle

1. Single Responsibilty Principle:
2. Open Closed Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface Segregation Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle

1. Single Responsibilty Principle (SRP): Each Class or module has ought to have single goal or responsibilty. 
   This Principle encourages to modularity and enhances code comprehension, Testing and maintaince.

2. Open/Closed Principle : Software Entities should be open for expansion but closed for modifications.It advocated that designing code in a way that allows new functionality to be added without altering existing code.
   This Principle promotes code reuse and scalability and minimize the risk of introducing bugs.
   
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): It emphasize that subtypes must be capable of substituting their base types without distrupting the program's correctness.In simple words, it should be possible to substitute an object belonging to its superclass with an object belonging to one of its subclasses without creating problems or divating fro its expected behaviours.
   This Principle ensures well designed inheritance hirerarchies.
   
4. Inteface Segregation Principle (ISP): The client should not compelled to depende interfaces they don't use.It recommend designing interface tailored to the specific needs of clients, preventing the implementaion of unneccssary methods.By keeping interfaces focused and concise.
    The principle encourgaes loose coupling and eases maintainance.
